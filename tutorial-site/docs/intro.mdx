# From Idea to TestFlight

**Build your first iOS app with React, Firebase, Capacitor & Claude Code.**

This is a free, step-by-step tutorial that takes you from a blank folder to a real iOS app running on TestFlight. No prior mobile development experience needed.

## What You'll Build

**GratitudeJar** — a daily journal app where every entry is a moment worth keeping. Write a thought or snap a photo. Shake the jar to rediscover a random past memory.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional iOS app with:

- **Text and photo journal entries** — create, read, edit, delete
- **Real-time sync** — entries update instantly across devices via Firebase
- **Camera integration** — take photos or pick from your library using native iOS APIs
- **Shake interaction** — shake your phone to surface a random past entry with haptic feedback
- **Calendar heatmap and streaks** — track your journaling habit
- **Authentication** — email/password login with guest mode fallback
- **TestFlight distribution** — your app, on real iPhones, shared with testers

## Who This Tutorial Is For

You should follow this tutorial if you:

- Have **never written code before** but want to build something real
- Know basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (or are actively learning)
- Have **never built an iOS app** before
- **Want to learn by doing, guided by AI** — each step gives you a prompt, Claude Code writes the code, and you learn from what it creates
- Are willing to work through challenges — this tutorial covers the hard parts too

You do **not** need prior experience with React, Firebase, Capacitor, TypeScript, or Xcode. We teach everything from scratch.

## What You'll Need

### Required

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **A Mac** | Xcode only runs on macOS. This is a hard requirement for iOS development. |
| **Node.js 18+** | Runtime for React, Vite, and all our tooling. |
| **Xcode 15+** | Apple's IDE for building and signing iOS apps. Free from the Mac App Store. |
| **Apple Developer Account** | Required for TestFlight. Costs $99/year. Sign up early — approval can take 24-48 hours. |
| **A code editor** | We recommend VS Code, but any editor works. |
| **Git** | For version control and accessing checkpoint branches. |
| **Claude Code** | Your AI coding partner for this entire tutorial. It writes the code; you learn from it. Free to try. |

### Nice to Have (Not Required)

| Tool | Why |
|---|---|
| **An iPhone** | For testing camera and shake features. The iOS Simulator works for most chapters. |

## How This Tutorial Works

### Sequential chapters

This tutorial is designed to be followed **in order**, from Chapter 1 through Chapter 19. Each chapter builds on the previous one.

### Prompt-driven development

Every step gives you a **prompt to send to Claude Code**. Claude Code writes the code, and we explain what it created and why. You learn by reviewing real code that Claude Code generated for your project — not by copying and pasting from a wall of text.

### Checkpoints

At the end of every chapter, you'll see a **checkpoint** — a screenshot of what your app should look like, a checklist of what should be working, and a link to the companion repo branch so you can compare your code.

### Claude Code is your coding partner

Claude Code is the **primary way you'll build this app**. Instead of manually typing out hundreds of lines of code, you send a prompt describing what you need, and Claude Code generates the actual code for your project. The prompts in this tutorial are carefully designed to produce the right code at each step.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  prompt="What does the onSnapshot function do in Firestore? Explain it like I'm a beginner."
  context="This is an example of how Claude Code prompts appear throughout the tutorial. Build prompts generate code; question prompts help you understand concepts."
  tip="You can ask Claude Code to explain any concept you encounter. It's like having a senior developer sitting next to you."
/>

### The prompt-driven workflow

Here is how every chapter works:

1. **You send a prompt** — Each step includes a prompt you copy and send to Claude Code in your terminal
2. **Claude Code writes the code** — It creates or modifies files in your project based on the prompt
3. **You review what it created** — We walk through the generated code and explain what each part does and why
4. **You learn from it** — By reading real, working code in context, you build understanding naturally

Terminal commands (like `npm install` or `git commit`) are still things you run yourself. But the app code? That comes from Claude Code.

### Time estimate

Plan for **20–30 hours** spread over a few weeks. Some chapters take 30 minutes, others (like the Xcode/TestFlight chapters) may take a couple of hours as you navigate Apple's tooling for the first time.

## The Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite | Fast, modern, huge community |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 | Utility-first, great for mobile-first design |
| **Icons** | Lucide React | Clean, consistent icon set |
| **Auth** | Firebase Authentication | Handles the hard parts of auth securely |
| **Database** | Cloud Firestore | Real-time, offline-capable, scales automatically |
| **File Storage** | Firebase Storage | Upload and serve photos with security rules |
| **Mobile Wrapper** | Capacitor | Turns your web app into a native iOS app |
| **Native Plugins** | @capacitor/camera, @capacitor/haptics | Access device camera and haptic engine |
| **AI Assistant** | Claude Code | Scaffold, debug, iterate, and learn faster |

## The Journey

| Part | Chapters | What You'll Build |
|---|---|---|
| **Part 1 — The Idea** | 1 | Blueprint: scope, wireframes, data model |
| **Part 2 — Foundation** | 2–3 | Dev environment + project scaffolding |
| **Part 3 — Web App** | 4–10 | Full web app: UI, CRUD, Firebase, auth, polish |
| **Part 4 — Going Mobile** | 11–14 | Capacitor, camera, shake, iOS polish |
| **Part 5 — TestFlight** | 15–17 | Certificates, App Store Connect, TestFlight |
| **Part 6 — Next Steps** | 18–19 | Iteration cycle + App Store submission |
