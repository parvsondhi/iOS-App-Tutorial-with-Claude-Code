# From Idea to TestFlight

**Build your first iOS app with React, Firebase, Capacitor & Claude Code.**

This is a free, step-by-step tutorial that takes you from a blank folder to a real iOS app running on TestFlight. No prior mobile development experience needed.

---

## What You'll Build

**GratitudeJar** — a daily journal app where every entry is a moment worth keeping. Write a thought or snap a photo. Shake the jar to rediscover a random past memory.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional iOS app with:

- **Text and photo journal entries** — create, read, edit, delete
- **Real-time sync** — entries update instantly across devices via Firebase
- **Camera integration** — take photos or pick from your library using native iOS APIs
- **Shake interaction** — shake your phone to surface a random past entry with haptic feedback
- **Calendar heatmap and streaks** — track your journaling habit
- **Authentication** — email/password login with guest mode fallback
- **TestFlight distribution** — your app, on real iPhones, shared with testers

## Who This Tutorial Is For

You should follow this tutorial if you:

- Know basic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (or are actively learning)
- Have **never built an iOS app** before
- Want to **build something real**, not another counter or todo app
- Are willing to work through challenges — this tutorial covers the hard parts too

You do **not** need prior experience with React, Firebase, Capacitor, TypeScript, or Xcode. We teach everything from scratch.

## What You'll Need

### Required

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **A Mac** | Xcode only runs on macOS. This is a hard requirement for iOS development. |
| **Node.js 18+** | Runtime for React, Vite, and all our tooling. |
| **Xcode 15+** | Apple's IDE for building and signing iOS apps. Free from the Mac App Store. |
| **Apple Developer Account** | Required for TestFlight. Costs $99/year. Sign up early — approval can take 24-48 hours. |
| **A code editor** | We recommend VS Code, but any editor works. |
| **Git** | For version control and accessing checkpoint branches. |

### Nice to Have (Not Required)

| Tool | Why |
|---|---|
| **An iPhone** | For testing camera and shake features. The iOS Simulator works for most chapters. |
| **Claude Code** | AI-assisted development at every step. Free to try. |

## How This Tutorial Works

### Sequential chapters

This tutorial is designed to be followed **in order**, from Chapter 1 through Chapter 19. Each chapter builds on the previous one.

### One concept at a time

Every step introduces **one new idea**. We explain the "why" before showing the "how." Code blocks are complete — you can copy and paste them directly.

### Checkpoints

At the end of every chapter, you'll see a **checkpoint** — a screenshot of what your app should look like, a checklist of what should be working, and a link to the companion repo branch so you can compare your code.

### Claude Code integration

Throughout the tutorial, you'll see **Claude Code prompts** showing how to use AI to accelerate your development. These are optional but recommended — they demonstrate a real-world workflow where AI handles boilerplate while you focus on understanding.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  prompt="What does the onSnapshot function do in Firestore? Explain it like I'm a beginner."
  context="This is an example of how Claude Code prompts appear throughout the tutorial."
  tip="You can ask Claude Code to explain any concept you encounter. It's like having a senior developer sitting next to you."
/>

### Time estimate

Plan for **20–30 hours** spread over a few weeks. Some chapters take 30 minutes, others (like the Xcode/TestFlight chapters) may take a couple of hours as you navigate Apple's tooling for the first time.

## The Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 19 + TypeScript + Vite | Fast, modern, huge community |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v4 | Utility-first, great for mobile-first design |
| **Icons** | Lucide React | Clean, consistent icon set |
| **Auth** | Firebase Authentication | Handles the hard parts of auth securely |
| **Database** | Cloud Firestore | Real-time, offline-capable, scales automatically |
| **File Storage** | Firebase Storage | Upload and serve photos with security rules |
| **Mobile Wrapper** | Capacitor | Turns your web app into a native iOS app |
| **Native Plugins** | @capacitor/camera, @capacitor/haptics | Access device camera and haptic engine |
| **AI Assistant** | Claude Code | Scaffold, debug, iterate, and learn faster |

## The Journey

| Part | Chapters | What You'll Build |
|---|---|---|
| **Part 1 — The Idea** | 1 | Blueprint: scope, wireframes, data model |
| **Part 2 — Foundation** | 2–3 | Dev environment + project scaffolding |
| **Part 3 — Web App** | 4–10 | Full web app: UI, CRUD, Firebase, auth, polish |
| **Part 4 — Going Mobile** | 11–14 | Capacitor, camera, shake, iOS polish |
| **Part 5 — TestFlight** | 15–17 | Certificates, App Store Connect, TestFlight |
| **Part 6 — Next Steps** | 18–19 | Iteration cycle + App Store submission |
