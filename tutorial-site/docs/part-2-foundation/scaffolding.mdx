# Chapter 3: Project Scaffolding

> Time to create the project and lay the foundation for everything that follows.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a running React + TypeScript project with Tailwind CSS styling, all dependencies installed, and your project structure organized. You'll see it live in the browser.

---

## What You'll Do

- Scaffold a new project with `npm create vite@latest`
- Install React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Firebase, and Lucide React
- Have Claude Code configure Tailwind, clean up starter files, and set up the project structure
- Define your TypeScript interfaces (`types.ts`)
- Create a Firebase project and get your config keys
- See your first `npm run dev` output

---

## Step 1: Create the Project with Vite

Open your terminal and navigate to where you want your project to live. Then run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest gratitude-jar -- --template react-ts
```

This creates a new folder called `gratitude-jar` with React + TypeScript already configured. Let's break down what just happened:

- `npm create vite@latest` — runs Vite's project generator
- `gratitude-jar` — the folder name
- `--template react-ts` — tells Vite to use the React + TypeScript template

Now enter the project and install the base dependencies:

```bash
cd gratitude-jar
npm install
```

### Test that it works

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. You should see the default Vite + React landing page with a counter button. That page is about to be replaced with our app — but it proves everything is wired up correctly.

Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the dev server.

---

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

We need several packages. Let's install them all at once:

```bash
# Core dependencies
npm install firebase lucide-react

# Tailwind CSS v4 (uses the new Vite plugin)
npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
```

### What did we just install?

| Package | What it does |
|---|---|
| `firebase` | Firebase SDK — auth, Firestore, storage |
| `lucide-react` | Beautiful open-source icon library |
| `tailwindcss` | Utility-first CSS framework |
| `@tailwindcss/vite` | Vite plugin for Tailwind CSS v4 |

:::info We'll Install Capacitor Later
Capacitor and its plugins are only needed when we wrap the web app for iOS in Part 4. Installing them now would just add confusion. One step at a time.
:::

---

## Step 3: Configure Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind CSS v4 uses a new Vite plugin instead of the old PostCSS setup. It's much simpler — and Claude Code can handle the entire configuration for you.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  variant="build"
  step="Step 3"
  prompt="Configure Tailwind CSS v4 in my Vite project. Add the @tailwindcss/vite plugin to vite.config.ts, replace src/index.css with just the Tailwind import, and remove src/App.css since we'll use Tailwind for all styling. Also remove the App.css import from App.tsx."
  context="Tailwind v4 uses a Vite plugin instead of the old PostCSS config. This is simpler and faster."
  expectedOutput="Claude Code will update vite.config.ts to include the tailwindcss() plugin, replace the contents of src/index.css with a single @import 'tailwindcss' line, delete src/App.css, and remove the App.css import from App.tsx."
  tip="After Claude Code makes these changes, restart your dev server (Ctrl+C then npm run dev) for the Tailwind plugin to take effect."
/>

### What Claude Code just did

- **`vite.config.ts`** — Added `tailwindcss()` to the plugins array alongside the existing `react()` plugin. This tells Vite to process Tailwind classes automatically.
- **`src/index.css`** — Replaced all the default CSS with a single `@import "tailwindcss"` line. That one import gives you access to every Tailwind utility class.
- **`src/App.css`** — Deleted entirely. We won't use component-specific CSS files — Tailwind handles all our styling through utility classes directly in the JSX.
- **`src/App.tsx`** — Removed the `import './App.css'` line since the file no longer exists.

---

## Step 4: Clean Up the Starter Files

Vite's template comes with demo content we don't need. Let's have Claude Code clear it out and set up our starting point.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  variant="build"
  step="Step 4"
  prompt="Clean up the Vite starter files for our GratitudeJar app. Replace src/App.tsx with a minimal component that shows 'GratitudeJar' centered on an amber background using Tailwind. Delete the unused react.svg and vite.svg files. Update the page title in index.html to 'GratitudeJar'."
  context="We're replacing Vite's demo content with a clean starting point for our app."
  expectedOutput="Claude Code will rewrite src/App.tsx with a simple centered layout using Tailwind's amber color scheme, delete src/assets/react.svg and public/vite.svg, and change the <title> in index.html to 'GratitudeJar'."
/>

### Test it

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see a warm amber page with "GratitudeJar" centered on the screen. If Tailwind classes are working (amber background, bold text), your setup is correct.

---

## Step 5: Set Up the Folder Structure

A clear folder structure keeps you organized as the app grows. Let Claude Code create the folders we'll need.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  variant="build"
  step="Step 5"
  prompt="Create the folder structure for our app: src/components/, src/pages/, src/lib/, and src/hooks/. These will hold our reusable components, page views, utilities, and custom React hooks."
  context="Organizing code into folders from the start prevents a messy project later."
  expectedOutput="Claude Code will create four new directories inside src/: components/, pages/, lib/, and hooks/."
/>

<FileTree title="src/ folder structure">

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components (Header, EntryCard, etc.)
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── lib/            # Utilities and config (firebase.ts, etc.)
├── pages/          # Full-page components (Feed, Profile, etc.)
├── App.tsx         # Root component
├── main.tsx        # Entry point
├── index.css       # Tailwind import
└── vite-env.d.ts   # Vite TypeScript declarations
```

</FileTree>

### Why this structure?

- **`components/`** — Small, reusable pieces. A button, a card, a header. These get used across multiple pages.
- **`pages/`** — One file per screen. `Feed.tsx`, `Profile.tsx`, etc. Each page composes components together.
- **`lib/`** — Configuration and utility functions. Firebase config lives here. Helper functions live here.
- **`hooks/`** — Custom React hooks like `useEntries()` or `useAuth()`. These encapsulate logic and keep components clean.

---

## Step 6: Create the TypeScript Types

In Chapter 1, we designed the `Entry` data model. Now let's make it real.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  variant="build"
  step="Step 6"
  prompt="Create a TypeScript types file at src/lib/types.ts for our GratitudeJar app. Define an Entry type with: id (string), type ('text' | 'photo'), content (string), caption (optional string), date (string in YYYY-MM-DD format), and createdAt (Firebase Timestamp). Also create a NewEntry type that omits id and createdAt since those are generated by Firebase."
  context="TypeScript types define the shape of your data. They catch bugs at compile time instead of at runtime."
  expectedOutput="Claude Code will create src/lib/types.ts with an Entry type containing all six fields and a NewEntry type using TypeScript's Omit utility type."
/>

### What's `NewEntry`?

When creating a new entry, we don't have an `id` yet (Firestore generates it) and `createdAt` is set server-side. The `Omit<Entry, 'id' | 'createdAt'>` utility creates a type that has all of `Entry`'s fields *except* those two. TypeScript will enforce this — if you accidentally try to set `id` on a `NewEntry`, it'll show an error.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  prompt="Explain the TypeScript Omit utility type. I'm using Omit<Entry, 'id' | 'createdAt'> to create a NewEntry type. How does this work?"
  context="Understanding utility types like Omit, Pick, and Partial will help you throughout this project."
  tip="Don't memorize everything — learn to ask when you hit something unfamiliar. That's what Claude Code is for."
/>

---

## Step 7: Set Up Firebase

Firebase provides our backend — authentication, database, and file storage — without building a server.

### Create a Firebase Project

1. Go to [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Click **Add project**
3. Name it `gratitude-jar` (or anything you like)
4. **Disable** Google Analytics (we don't need it and it adds complexity)
5. Click **Create project**

### Register a Web App

1. In your Firebase project dashboard, click the **web icon** (`</>`) to add a web app
2. Name it `gratitude-jar-web`
3. **Don't** check "Also set up Firebase Hosting" — we'll use Vercel
4. Click **Register app**
5. Firebase will show you a config object — **copy it**. It looks like this:

```ts
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSy...",
  authDomain: "gratitude-jar-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "gratitude-jar-xxxxx",
  storageBucket: "gratitude-jar-xxxxx.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abc123"
}
```

### Enable Firestore

1. In the Firebase console, go to **Build → Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database**
3. Choose **Start in test mode** (we'll add security rules later)
4. Pick a location close to you (e.g., `us-central1` for North America)

### Enable Storage

1. Go to **Build → Storage**
2. Click **Get started**
3. Choose **Start in test mode**
4. Same location as Firestore

### Enable Authentication

1. Go to **Build → Authentication**
2. Click **Get started**
3. Under **Sign-in method**, enable **Email/Password**

---

## Step 8: Configure Environment Variables

Never commit API keys directly in your code. We'll use environment variables instead.

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash title=".env"
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=gratitude-jar-xxxxx.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=gratitude-jar-xxxxx
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=gratitude-jar-xxxxx.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=123456789
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:123456789:web:abc123
```

Replace the values with the ones from your Firebase config.

:::caution Why VITE_ Prefix?
Vite only exposes environment variables that start with `VITE_` to your frontend code. This is a safety feature — it prevents accidentally leaking server-side secrets to the browser. We prefix all our variables with `VITE_` so they're accessible via `import.meta.env.VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`.
:::

### Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

Create a `.gitignore` file in the root (Vite may have already created one) and make sure it includes:

```bash title=".gitignore"
node_modules
dist
.env
.env.local
```

### Create the Firebase config file

Now let Claude Code create the file that initializes Firebase in your app.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  variant="build"
  step="Step 8"
  prompt="Create the Firebase configuration file at src/lib/firebase.ts. It should initialize Firebase using environment variables (VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY, VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN, VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET, VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID, VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID) and export the db (Firestore), storage, and auth instances."
  context="This file is the single source of truth for Firebase in your app. Every other file that needs Firebase will import from here."
  expectedOutput="Claude Code will create src/lib/firebase.ts that imports Firebase modules, reads config from import.meta.env variables, calls initializeApp(), and exports db, storage, and auth."
  tip="Make sure your .env file is saved before running this — Claude Code may try to verify the environment variables exist."
/>

This file is the single source of truth for Firebase in your app. Every other file that needs Firebase will import from here.

---

## Step 9: Initialize Git

Let's turn your project into a Git repository and make the first commit:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup: React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Firebase config"
```

### Connect to GitHub

If you created a GitHub repo in Chapter 2:

```bash
# Using SSH (recommended)
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/gratitude-jar.git

# Or using HTTPS
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gratitude-jar.git

# Push
git push -u origin main
```

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  prompt="I just scaffolded a Vite + React + TypeScript project and installed Firebase, Tailwind CSS v4, and Lucide React. Review my project structure and tell me if I'm missing anything before I start building components."
  context="A quick sanity check before we start building the actual UI."
  tip="Claude Code can spot missing configs, incorrect imports, and common setup mistakes."
/>

---

## Step 10: Final Verification

Let's make sure everything works together. Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and confirm:

1. The page loads with a warm amber background
2. The text "GratitudeJar" appears centered and bold
3. No errors in the browser console (`Cmd + Option + J` in Chrome)
4. No errors in the terminal
