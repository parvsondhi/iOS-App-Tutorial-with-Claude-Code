# Chapter 2: Dev Environment Setup

> Before we write any code, we need the right tools installed and configured.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a fully working development environment ready for React, Firebase, and iOS development.

## What You'll Install

- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **VS Code** with recommended extensions
- **Xcode 15+** (this is a big download — start it early)
- **Git** for version control
- **Claude Code** (optional but recommended)
