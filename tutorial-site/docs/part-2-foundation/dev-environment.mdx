# Chapter 2: Dev Environment Setup

> Before we write any code, we need the right tools installed and configured.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a fully working development environment ready for React, Firebase, and iOS development. This is the "boring" chapter — but skipping it is the #1 reason beginners get stuck later.

---

## What You'll Install

- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **VS Code** with recommended extensions
- **Xcode 15+** (this is a big download — start it early)
- **Git** for version control
- **Claude Code** (optional but recommended)

---

## Step 1: Install Xcode (Start This First)

Xcode is Apple's IDE for iOS development. It includes the iOS Simulator, build tools, and everything Capacitor needs to compile your app. The download is **~8 GB**, so start it now and let it download while you set up everything else.

1. Open the **Mac App Store**
2. Search for **Xcode**
3. Click **Get** / **Install**
4. Once installed, open Xcode once to accept the license agreement
5. Let it install the additional components when prompted

### Install Xcode Command Line Tools

Even if Xcode is still downloading, you can install the command line tools right away:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

A dialog will pop up asking you to install. Click **Install** and wait for it to finish.

### Verify

```bash
xcode-select -p
# Should output: /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

xcodebuild -version
# Should output something like: Xcode 15.4
```

:::tip Don't Skip Xcode
Even though we won't use Xcode until Part 4, installing it now saves you from a painful 30-minute wait later when you're in the flow of building. Trust us on this one.

## Step 2: Install Node.js

Node.js is the runtime that powers React, Vite, and all our command-line tools. We recommend **Node.js 20 LTS** (Long Term Support).

### Option A: Direct Download (Simplest)

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the **LTS** version (should be 20.x or newer)
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts

### Option B: Using nvm (Recommended for Developers)

`nvm` (Node Version Manager) lets you switch between Node.js versions easily. This is useful if you work on multiple projects.

```bash
# Install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

# Close and reopen your terminal, then:
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20
```

### Verify

```bash
node -v
# Should output: v20.x.x (anything 18+ works)

npm -v
# Should output: 10.x.x (comes bundled with Node)
```

---

## Step 3: Install Git

Git tracks changes to your code. You'll use it to save progress at the end of every chapter.

### Check if Git is already installed

```bash
git --version
# If you see a version number, you're good!
```

If it's not installed, the Xcode command line tools (Step 1) should have included it. If you still don't have it:

```bash
# Install via Homebrew (if you have it)
brew install git

# Or download from: https://git-scm.com/download/mac
```

### Configure Git (first time only)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"
```

Use the same email you use for GitHub — this links your commits to your account.

---

## Step 4: Install VS Code

VS Code is our recommended code editor. It's free, fast, and has excellent extensions for everything we're using.

1. Download from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Move the app to your **Applications** folder
3. Open it

### Install the `code` command

This lets you open files and folders from the terminal:

1. Open VS Code
2. Press `Cmd + Shift + P` to open the Command Palette
3. Type **"shell command"** and select **"Install 'code' command in PATH"**

Now you can do:

```bash
code .          # Open current folder in VS Code
code myfile.ts  # Open a specific file
```

### Recommended Extensions

Open the Extensions panel (`Cmd + Shift + X`) and install these:

| Extension | Why |
|---|---|
| **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** | Autocomplete for Tailwind classes |
| **ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native Snippets** | Type `rafce` to scaffold a component |
| **Prettier - Code formatter** | Auto-format on save |
| **Error Lens** | Shows errors inline instead of just in the Problems tab |
| **Auto Rename Tag** | Rename opening tags and closing tags together |

### Configure Auto-Format on Save

Open VS Code settings (`Cmd + ,`) and search for "format on save." Check the box. Then set the default formatter to **Prettier**.

Or add this to your `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-io"
}
```

## Step 5: Create a GitHub Account and Repository

We'll use GitHub to store our code and eventually connect it to Vercel for deployment.

1. Create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one
2. Create a new repository:
   - Name: `gratitude-jar` (or whatever you like)
   - Keep it **Public** (or Private — your choice)
   - **Don't** add a README, .gitignore, or license — we'll create these ourselves

### Set Up SSH Authentication (Optional but Recommended)

SSH lets you push code to GitHub without typing your password every time:

```bash
# Generate a key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"
# Press Enter for default location, then set a passphrase (or leave empty)

# Copy the public key
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add it to GitHub:
# Go to github.com → Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key
# Paste the key and save
```

Test it:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
# Should say: Hi username! You've successfully authenticated...
```

## Step 6: Install Claude Code (Optional)

Claude Code is an AI coding assistant that runs in your terminal. Throughout this tutorial, you'll see optional Claude Code prompts showing how AI can help you code faster.

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

After installing, run `claude` in your terminal to set up authentication.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  prompt="Check my development environment. I need Node.js 18+, Git, and VS Code installed for a React + Firebase + Capacitor project. Tell me if anything is missing."
  context="You can use Claude Code to verify your setup before moving on."
  tip="This is a great first interaction with Claude Code — it can check versions and spot issues you might miss."
/>

:::info Claude Code Is Optional
Every Claude Code prompt in this tutorial shows you an **optional** way to accelerate your workflow. The tutorial works perfectly fine without it. Think of it as having a knowledgeable colleague available to ask questions.

## Step 7: Verify Everything

Let's make sure all our tools are installed and working. Run each of these commands:

```bash
# Node.js and npm
node -v          # v18.0.0 or higher
npm -v           # 9.0.0 or higher

# Git
git --version    # git version 2.x.x

# Xcode
xcode-select -p  # /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
xcodebuild -version  # Xcode 15.x or higher

# VS Code (if you installed the code command)
code --version   # 1.x.x

# Claude Code (if installed)
claude --version
```

If any command fails, go back to the relevant step above and troubleshoot.

<TroubleshootingAccordion items={[
  {
    error: "xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed",
    solution: <p>This actually means you're fine — the tools are installed. Run <code>xcode-select -p</code> to confirm.</p>
  },
  {
    error: "nvm: command not found",
    solution: <p>Close your terminal completely and reopen it. If that doesn't work, add this to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file: <code>export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"</code> and <code>[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && . "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"</code>. Then restart your terminal.</p>
  },
  {
    error: "npm ERR! EACCES: permission denied",
    solution: <p>Don't use <code>sudo npm install</code> — that causes more problems. Instead, fix npm permissions: <code>mkdir ~/.npm-global && npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'</code>. Then add <code>export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH</code> to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> and restart your terminal.</p>
  },
  {
    error: "xcrun: error: unable to find utility 'simctl'",
    solution: <p>Xcode is installed but the command line tools aren't pointed at it. Run: <code>sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer</code>.</p>
  }
