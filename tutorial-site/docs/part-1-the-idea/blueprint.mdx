# Chapter 1: From Idea to Blueprint

> Every app starts as a vague idea. This chapter turns yours into a concrete plan.

By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clear picture of what you're building, why each technology was chosen, and a data model that will guide every line of code you write.

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to scope an MVP — what to build first, what to cut
- Simple wireframe sketching
- Designing your data model before writing code
- Why this tech stack: React + Firebase + Capacitor
- The difference between a web app, a PWA, and a native app

---

## The App: GratitudeJar

Let's start with what we're building and why.

**GratitudeJar** is a daily journal app. The concept is simple:

1. **Write** a thought or **snap** a photo
2. **Browse** past entries in a scrollable feed
3. **Shake** the phone to rediscover a random memory

That's it. Three core interactions. The simplicity is the point — it lets us focus on learning the full stack without getting lost in complex business logic.

### Why a journal app?

- **Universal appeal** — everyone can relate to journaling
- **Natural daily habit** — gives the app a reason to exist on your phone
- **Covers the full stack** — auth, database, file storage, native APIs
- **The shake interaction** — this is the hero moment. Nothing makes you feel like you built a "real app" faster than shaking your phone and having something happen.

## Scoping Your MVP

MVP stands for **Minimum Viable Product** — the smallest version of your app that still delivers value. The trap most beginners fall into is trying to build everything at once.

### What's IN the MVP

| Feature | Why it's essential |
|---|---|
| Create text entries | Core functionality |
| Create photo entries | Teaches file uploads |
| View entry feed | Users need to see their data |
| Edit and delete entries | Complete CRUD cycle |
| Shake to show random entry | The "wow" feature |
| Basic authentication | Protect user data |

### What's OUT of the MVP (for now)

| Feature | Why we're cutting it |
|---|---|
| Social sharing | Adds complexity without teaching new concepts |
| Tags and categories | Nice to have, not essential |
| Push notifications | Requires additional setup and a server |
| Multiple journals | Overcomplicates the data model |
| Rich text editor | A rabbit hole — plain text is fine |

:::tip The MVP Rule
If you're unsure whether a feature belongs in the MVP, cut it. You can always add it later. Shipping something simple that works is infinitely better than not shipping something complex.

## Wireframes

You don't need fancy tools. A pen and paper works. Here's what we're sketching:

### Screen 1: Entry Feed

The main screen. A scrollable list of entries, newest first. Text entries show the content preview. Photo entries show the image with an optional caption.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  GratitudeJar      [+]  │
├─────────────────────────┤
│                         │
│  ┌─────────────────┐    │
│  │ Today            │    │
│  │ Grateful for...  │    │
│  └─────────────────┘    │
│                         │
│  ┌─────────────────┐    │
│  │ [  Photo     ]   │    │
│  │ Sunset walk      │    │
│  └─────────────────┘    │
│                         │
│  ┌─────────────────┐    │
│  │ Yesterday        │    │
│  │ Good coffee...   │    │
│  └─────────────────┘    │
│                         │
├─────────────────────────┤
│  Feed    (+)   Profile  │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Screen 2: Create Entry

A modal that slides up. Toggle between text and photo. Simple form with a save button.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│  New Entry        [X]   │
├─────────────────────────┤
│                         │
│  [Text] [Photo]         │
│                         │
│  ┌─────────────────┐    │
│  │                  │    │
│  │  Write your      │    │
│  │  thought here... │    │
│  │                  │    │
│  └─────────────────┘    │
│                         │
│  ┌─────────────────────┐│
│  │     Save Entry      ││
│  └─────────────────────┘│
└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Screen 3: Shake Result

When you shake the phone, a card animates into view showing a random past entry.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│                         │
│    ┌───────────────┐    │
│    │                │    │
│    │  ✨ From your  │    │
│    │  jar:          │    │
│    │                │    │
│    │  "The sunset   │    │
│    │   was amazing  │    │
│    │   today"       │    │
│    │                │    │
│    │  Mar 15, 2025  │    │
│    │                │    │
│    └───────────────┘    │
│                         │
│     [Shake Again]       │
│                         │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

  tip="Claude Code is great at helping you think through UX flows before you write any code. Describe your app concept and ask it to help you plan."

## Data Model

Before writing any code, we design the data model. This is the shape of the data your app will store.

```ts
type Entry = {
  id: string          // Unique identifier (Firestore auto-generates this)
  type: "text" | "photo"  // What kind of entry
  content: string     // Text body OR Firebase Storage URL for photos
  caption?: string    // Optional caption (photo entries only)
  date: string        // "YYYY-MM-DD" format
  createdAt: Timestamp // Firebase server timestamp for ordering
}
```

### Why these fields?

- **`id`** — Every entry needs a unique identifier. Firestore generates these automatically.
- **`type`** — Tells us how to render the entry. Text entries show the content as text. Photo entries show the content as an image URL.
- **`content`** — Does double duty. For text entries, it's the journal text. For photo entries, it's the URL of the uploaded image. This keeps the model simple.
- **`caption?`** — Optional. Only makes sense for photo entries. The `?` in TypeScript means this field can be omitted.
- **`date`** — A simple string like `"2025-03-15"`. We use this for grouping entries by day and for the calendar heatmap.
- **`createdAt`** — Firebase's server-side timestamp. This ensures entries sort correctly even if the user's phone clock is wrong.

<ClaudeCodePrompt
  prompt="Review this TypeScript data model for a journal app. The Entry type has id, type (text or photo), content, optional caption, date string, and createdAt Timestamp. Are there any edge cases or improvements I should consider?"
  tip="Getting a second opinion on your data model before building on top of it can save hours of refactoring later."
/>

## Why This Tech Stack

### React + Vite + TypeScript

**React** is the most popular frontend framework. The skills you learn here transfer directly to job opportunities. **Vite** is the modern build tool — it's fast and requires almost zero configuration. **TypeScript** adds type safety — it catches bugs before they reach the browser.

### Tailwind CSS

Instead of writing CSS files, you style elements directly with utility classes: `className="text-lg font-bold text-gray-900"`. It's fast to write, easy to maintain, and perfect for mobile-first design.

### Firebase (Auth + Firestore + Storage)

Firebase gives us three backend services in one:
- **Authentication** — login/signup without building a server
- **Firestore** — a real-time database that syncs automatically
- **Storage** — upload and serve photos with security rules

The alternative would be building a custom backend with Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and AWS S3. That's 10x more work and teaches backend development, not mobile app development.

### Capacitor

Capacitor wraps your web app in a native iOS shell. Your React code runs inside a WKWebView (Safari's rendering engine), but you get access to native APIs like the camera and haptics through JavaScript plugins.

**Why not React Native?** React Native requires you to learn a different set of components (`<View>` instead of `<div>`). With Capacitor, you write standard HTML/CSS/JS and it just works on iOS. The learning curve is much lower.

## Web App vs. PWA vs. Native App

| | Web App | PWA | Native (Capacitor) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Runs in** | Browser | Browser (installable) | Native app shell |
| **App Store** | No | No | Yes |
| **Camera access** | Limited | Limited | Full |
| **Haptics** | No | No | Yes |
| **Offline** | Manual | Service Worker | Built-in |
| **TestFlight** | No | No | Yes |

We're building all three, progressively:
1. **Chapters 4–10**: Web app (works in any browser)
2. **Chapters 11–14**: Wrap it with Capacitor (becomes a native iOS app)
3. **Chapters 15–17**: Ship to TestFlight

## What's Next

You now have:
- A clear MVP scope
- Wireframes for the three main screens
- A data model to build on
- An understanding of why each technology was chosen

In the next chapter, we'll set up your development environment — Node.js, VS Code, Xcode, and everything else you need to start coding.
